MM - CombinedCssFix Module

This module adds the following functionality:
* Fixes Magento's CSS cache detection to force it to generate a separate combined CSS file for HTTPS pages.
* Should eliminate mixed content warnings on checkout due to combined CSS.

Let me know if you have any trouble installing. Thanks!
